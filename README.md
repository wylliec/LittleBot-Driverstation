LittleBot-Driverstation
=======================
LittleBot Driverstation is an android app that allows users to control FRC robots from their android devices.  The app features a configurable layout for joysticks, sliders, and buttons; and minor video streaming support.

The app supports the <2015 protocol of FRC robots so it will not work for any robots that use the roboRIO as opposed to the cRIO.  Anyone who wants to help update the app for the new protocol feel free to do so.  I myself will not have time to update the protocol durring 2015 since I will be busy building our team's robot.
